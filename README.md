Laravel AWS Webhooks (WiseTailLab Fork)
=======================================

[![License](https://poser.pugx.org/renoki-co/laravel-aws-webhooks/license)](https://packagist.org/packages/renoki-co/laravel-aws-webhooks)

This is a **WiseTailLab fork** of [renoki-co/laravel-aws-webhooks](https://github.com/renoki-co/laravel-aws-webhooks) - an easy webhook handler for Laravel to catch AWS SNS notifications for various services in a more eloquent way.

**Fork Purpose**: This fork is maintained by WiseTailLab to provide enhanced Laravel version support (10, 11, 12) and additional features needed for our projects.

Laravel AWS Webhooks leverages [wisetaillab/laravel-sns-events](https://github.com/wisetaillab/laravel-sns-events) (our fork of renoki-co/laravel-sns-events), a package that implements the basic functionalities of SNS HTTP/HTTPS requests, so that you can focus just on handling the event.
